# OFFLOADING-IN-CLOUD-FOG-ENVIRONMENT-USING-FEDERATED-LEARNING-
Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for intelligent service offloading in fog–cloud environments. It combines multi-agent DRL with federated learning to merge local and global knowledge, improving latency, energy efficiency, and scalability for resource-constrained, time-sensitive IoT systems.
